Your Project
------------

On the front-end,
- edit `public/client.js`, `public/style.css` and `views/index.html`
- drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,
- your app starts at `server.js`
- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

N.B it is used a mLab mongodb database. There are these env variables:

```
MONGOLAB_URI=mongodb://test:test@ds038547.mlab.com:38547/file-metadata
```
To use these variables you should store them in a .env file
